   3-49       diagnosis group counts 9 months before heart attack
    50        total cost 9 months before heart attack

    98        total cost 6 months before heart attack
   99-145     diagnosis group counts 3 months before heart attack

   147        Yes/No heart attack
_________________________________________________________________
- Randomly partition the full data set into two separate parts test and train,  50-50. This was done evenly
within each cost bin. 
- The training  set was used to develop the method. 2nd part was the test set. Used to evaluate the models performance.

  -- Patients in each bucket may have different characteristics. For this reason, we create clusters for each cost bucket
     AND make predictions for each cluster using Random Forest Algorithm.
   
  - Clustering is used in the absence of a target variable to search for relationships among input variables to organize data
    into meaningful groups. Although the target variable is well-defined as a heart attack, or not, there are many different trajectories
    that are associated with the target. There is no one set pattern that leads to a heart attack.

Spectral clustering method and k-means.

K-Means Algorithm: 
1. specify number of clusters k
2. randomly assign each data point to a cluster
3. compute cluster centroids
4. re assingn each point to the clostest cluster centroid
5. Re-compute cluster centroids
6. Repeat 4 & 5 until no improvement is made.

Practical considerations:
1. Number of clusters k can be selected from previous knowledge or experimenting.
2. Can strategically select initial partition of points into clusters if you have some knowledge of the data.
3. Can run algorithm several times with different random starting points.

Random forest without clustering: cost bucket 1: 49% bucket 2: 56% bucket 3: 58.3%
              With Clustering   :             1: 65%        2: 73%        3: 78.25%

""" 
We see that accuracy increases when clustering is added.
