# Machine Learning with R!

How to read a data set into R. The web-link to your .csv file goes inside quotations.
```R
IBM = read.csv(" ")
```
For python you could just do
```Python
import pandas as pd
IBM = pd.read_csv(" ")
```

If you don't have a link to the data, and it is saved on your computer in .csv format
here is a [website](http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/resources/R/reading_and_writing.html) that shows you how to access it in R.
The same will go for python. However, use the function 
```Python
pd.read_csv()
```

I will analyze data from different data sets. 
- This repo will show you how to plot, manipulate, and analyze data. And hopefully give you enough skills to go further.

This is a nice [website](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2598083/application-development/app-development-beginner-s-guide-to-r-easy-ways-to-do-basic-data-analysis.html?page=2) for basic R commands for data analysis.
