# Machine Learning with R!

How to read a data set into R. The web-link to your .csv file goes inside quotations.
```R
IBM = read.csv(" ")
```
For python you could just do
```Python
import pandas as pd
IBM = pd.read_csv(" ")
```

If you don't have a link to the data, and it is saved on your computer in .csv format
here is a [website](http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/resources/R/reading_and_writing.html) that shows you how to access it in R.
The same will go for python. However, use the function 
```Python
pd.read_csv()
```

I will analyze data from different data sets. 
- This repo will show you how to plot, manipulate, and analyze data. And hopefully give you enough skills to go further.

This is a nice [website](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2598083/application-development/app-development-beginner-s-guide-to-r-easy-ways-to-do-basic-data-analysis.html?page=2) for basic R commands for data analysis.



# What you will find:
1. Analyzing .csv files
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Text Analytics (Sentiment Analysis using Twitter)
5. Hierarchical Clustering
6. Random Forest
7. CART models
 ###### Much More to come.

# Want to learn machine learning?
1. I recommend Andrew Ng's Machine learning [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599).
You could also find an updated version on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org).
2. I recommend reading [Introduction to Statisical learning with Applications in R.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
- Really Awesome Book! 
3. To be implemented with **number 2** for way way way more (beneficial) theory is [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).
4. One more book, really good, [machine learning in R](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Second-Brett-Lantz/dp/1784393908/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0/143-6149364-6895049?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=JRA2684XMA1ZDCEYP504).

## Pre-requisites:
1. Linear Algebra (One of the most important and fundamental topics to continue in the ML field).
2. It is assumed you have taken the full calculus sequence.
3. Probability and Statistics.
4. Basic programming knowledge.
