# Machine Learning with R!

How to read a data set into R. The web-link to your .csv file goes inside quotations.
```R
IBM = read.csv(" ")
```
For python you could just do
```Python
import pandas as pd
IBM = pd.read_csv(" ")
```

If you don't have a link to the data, and it is saved on your computer in .csv format
here is a [website](http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/resources/R/reading_and_writing.html) that shows you how to access it in R.
The same will go for python. However, use the function 
```Python
pd.read_csv()
```

I will analyze data from different data sets. 
- This repo will show you how to plot, manipulate, and analyze data. And hopefully give you enough skills to go further.

This is a nice [website](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2598083/application-development/app-development-beginner-s-guide-to-r-easy-ways-to-do-basic-data-analysis.html?page=2) for basic R commands for data analysis.



# What you will find:
1. Analyzing .csv files
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Text Analytics (Sentiment Analysis using Twitter)
5. Hierarchical Clustering
6. Random Forest
7. CART models
 ###### Much More to come.

# Want to learn machine learning?
1. I recommend Andrew Ng's Machine learning [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599).
You could also find an updated version on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org).
2. I recommend reading [Introduction to Statisical learning with Applications in R.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
- Really Awesome Book! 
3. To be implemented with **number 2** for way way way more (beneficial) theory is [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/).
4. Had to add [this book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) on R. It is too good. Too good.
